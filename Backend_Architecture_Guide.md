# 🎯 Backend Architecture Overview: Complete Guide - (updated: 2025-07-26)

Imagine you've just joined our soccer analytics company. Let me walk you through the entire backend system we've built for automated soccer ball touch detection.

## 🏗️ **Overall System Architecture**

```
Frontend (React) → Backend API (FastAPI) → Video Processor → Database → Results
                                    ↓
                            YOLO Model + Traditional CV
```

## 📁 **Backend Directory Structure Breakdown**

### `/backend/main.py` - **The Control Center**
**What it is:** The main FastAPI application server
**Why important:** This is your mission control - handles all API requests from the frontend
**What you can do:**
- Upload videos for analysis
- Check processing status
- Retrieve analysis results
- Monitor system health

**Key endpoints:**
```python
POST /upload           # Upload new video
GET /status/{video_id} # Check if video is done processing
GET /results/{video_id}# Get analysis results
GET /videos           # List all processed videos
DELETE /video/{video_id} # Clean up old videos
```

**Business value:** This is how customers interact with your system. Every video upload, every result retrieved goes through here.

### `/backend/video_processor.py` - **The AI Brain** 🧠
**What it is:** The core computer vision engine that analyzes soccer videos
**Why important:** This is where the magic happens - it finds balls and detects touches
**What it does:**

#### **🔍 Ball Detection (3 Methods)**
1. **YOLO v2 Model** (Primary - Our Custom AI)
   - Trained specifically on your soccer videos
   - 13.8% detection rate (5.75x better than original)
   - Green circles in debug frames
   
2. **Traditional HSV Color Detection** (Fallback)
   - Finds orange/white round objects
   - Works when YOLO fails
   - Red/yellow circles in debug frames

3. **Hough Circle Detection** (Backup)
   - Mathematical circle detection
   - Last resort method

#### **👦 Pose Detection**
- Uses MediaPipe to find player's feet
- Blue circles around foot positions
- Essential for determining ball touches

#### **⚽ Touch Logic**
```python
if ball_near_foot AND ball_moving AND not_recent_touch:
    register_touch()
```

**Key metrics it tracks:**
- Total touches detected
- Confidence scores per touch
- Timestamps and positions
- Processing quality assessment

### `/backend/database.py` - **The Memory System** 💾
**What it is:** SQLite database interface for storing all video analysis data
**Why important:** Keeps track of every video ever processed, results, and system state

**Key tables:**
```sql
videos              # Main video records
├── id             # Unique video identifier  
├── filename       # Original file name
├── status         # UPLOADED→PROCESSING→COMPLETED→ERROR
├── total_touches  # Final touch count
├── confidence_score # Overall analysis confidence
└── results_path   # Where to find detailed results
```

**What you can do:**
- Query processing history
- Track system performance over time
- Debug failed analyses
- Generate usage reports

## 🚀 **Training Data System** (Advanced AI Pipeline)

### `/training_data/` - **The Learning Factory**
This is where we continuously improve the AI model:

#### **Data Collection Pipeline:**
```
YouTube Videos → Frame Extraction → Manual Annotation → YOLO Training → Model Deployment
```

#### **Key components:**

**`/scrapers/`** - Automated data collection
- `youtube_scraper.py`: Downloads soccer videos
- `instagram_scraper.py`: Collects social media content
- Runs 24/7 to gather training data

**`/processors/`** - Data preparation
- Converts videos to training format
- Creates bounding box labels
- Quality filtering and validation

**`/experiments/`** - Model training results
- `soccer_ball_detector/`: Original YouTube-trained model
- `real_detector_v2/`: Your improved model (13.8% detection rate)
- Training metrics, weights, performance graphs

**`/automation/`** - Self-improving system
- `dataset_manager.py`: Manages training datasets
- `training_pipeline.py`: Automated retraining
- `deployment_manager.py`: Safe model updates

## 🎛️ **What Each Backend Section Does**

### **1. Video Upload & Processing Flow**
```
User uploads video → Validates format → Stores in /uploads/raw/ → 
Queues for processing → Runs AI analysis → Saves results → Notifies frontend
```

### **2. Real-time Status Tracking**
- Database tracks: UPLOADED → PROCESSING → COMPLETED
- Frontend polls status every 2 seconds
- Error handling for failed analyses

### **3. Result Storage System**
```
/uploads/
├── raw/           # Original uploaded videos
├── processed/     # JSON analysis results  
└── frames/        # Debug screenshots showing detections
```

### **4. AI Model Integration**
- Loads YOLO model on startup
- Optimized 0.05 confidence threshold
- Falls back to traditional detection if AI fails
- Logs which detection method was used

---

## 🔧 **Configuration & Settings**

### **Environment Variables:**
```python
UPLOAD_DIR = "/uploads"           # Where videos are stored
MAX_FILE_SIZE = 100MB            # Upload limit
PROCESSING_TIMEOUT = 300s        # Max analysis time
MODEL_PATH = "training_data/..."  # AI model location
```

### **Performance Tuning:**
```python
frame_skip = 3              # Process every 3rd frame (speed vs accuracy)
target_width = 1280         # Resize large videos
yolo_confidence = 0.05      # Detection sensitivity
touch_threshold = 50        # Pixels between ball and foot
```

- Detection accuracy improvements
- Model deployment success rate

---

## 🛠️ **Day-to-Day Operations**

### **As a Backend Engineer, you would:**

**Daily (5 minutes):**
- Check database for failed analyses: `SELECT * FROM videos WHERE status='ERROR'`
- Monitor processing queue length
- Review detection confidence trends

**Weekly (30 minutes):**
- Analyze model performance metrics
- Review customer feedback on accuracy
- Plan training data collection priorities

**Monthly (2 hours):**
- Retrain models with new data
- Performance optimization analysis
- System capacity planning

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting Guide**

### **Common Issues:**

**"Video stuck in PROCESSING"**
- Check video_processor.py logs
- Verify YOLO model loaded correctly
- Check disk space in /uploads/

**"Low detection accuracy"**
- Review confidence thresholds
- Check if YOLO model is being used
- Analyze lighting/quality of video

**"Upload failures"**
- Verify file size limits
- Check video format support
- Review network timeouts

**"Backend won't start - missing logs directory"**
- Create missing directory: `mkdir -p training_data/logs`
- Common when moving between environments
