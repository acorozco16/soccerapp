# ⚽ Youth Soccer Development Platform

Transform backyard practice into measurable skill development. Track your child's soccer progress with AI-powered video analysis and comprehensive player ratings that grow over years.

## 🎯 What We're Building

**Not just a touch counter** - A complete development platform that turns every backyard practice session into meaningful progress data.

### 🏆 Player Development System
Track comprehensive soccer skills with age-appropriate ratings:

**Example Player Profile - Age 12**
```
Overall Rating: 72 ⭐⭐⭐ (+4 this season)

🏃 Pace: 65        ⚽ Ball Control: 78  
🎯 Accuracy: 59    🦶 Footwork: 74
👟 First Touch: 71 🧠 Decision Making: 69

Potential: 82 Rating
```

### 📈 Multi-Drill Platform
Start with keep-ups, expand to comprehensive footwork training:

**Phase 1 (Current)**: Keep-ups Analysis
- Ball juggling touch counting
- 85-90% accuracy target
- Foundation for all future drills

**Phase 2-5 (Roadmap)**: Complete Skill Development
- Cone dribbling (speed & agility)
- Wall passes (first touch quality)
- Juggling patterns (left/right foot balance)
- Step-over drills (advanced footwork)

All designed for **backyard practice** using equipment families already have.

## 🎯 Current Features (Keep-ups MVP)

### 🤖 AI-Powered Analysis
- **Advanced ball detection** using YOLO v8 + ByteTrack
- **Smart frame sampling** processes all frames during critical moments
- **MediaPipe pose detection** for accurate foot positioning
- **Trajectory prediction** handles motion blur and occlusion
- **Quality assessment** with automatic video optimization

### 📱 Family-Friendly Interface
- **Mobile-first design** optimized for smartphone uploads
- **Real-time progress tracking** with detailed analysis
- **Visual touch detection** shows exactly what was counted
- **Age-appropriate benchmarks** compare progress with peers
- **Development history** tracks improvement over months/years

## 📊 Target Accuracy & Performance

### Keep-ups Detection (Current)
- **88-92% accuracy** on typical backyard videos
- **±2-3 touches** typical variance for 30-60 second sessions  
- **Works with standard smartphones** (no special equipment needed)
- **2-3 minute processing** time per video

### Future Drill Accuracy Targets
- **Cone dribbling timing**: 95%+ (easier to track)
- **Wall pass counting**: 90%+ 
- **Footwork patterns**: 85%+ (complex movements)

## 🚀 Quick Start for Parents

### Upload & Analyze
1. **Record video** of keep-ups practice (30-60 seconds)
2. **Upload through web app** (works on any device)
3. **Get instant analysis** with touch count and highlights
4. **Track progress** over time with rating improvements

### Video Recording Tips
- **Good lighting** (outdoor daylight or bright indoor)
- **Keep ball in frame** throughout the session  
- **Steady camera** (hand-held is fine)
- **Orange or white ball** for best detection
- **30-60 seconds** optimal length
