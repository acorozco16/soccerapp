2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate it:
   - Mac/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
   - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`

4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   
   You should see: `Server running at http://localhost:8000`

### Step 3: Set Up the Frontend (Web Interface)

1. Open a NEW terminal window
2. Navigate to frontend folder:
   ```bash
   cd soccer-app/frontend
   ```

   You should see: `Local: http://localhost:3000`

### Step 4: Use the App!

1. Open your web browser
2. Go to: http://localhost:3000
3. Click "Upload Video" and select a soccer video from your phone
4. Wait for processing (usually 1-3 minutes)
5. View your results!

## üì± Recording Tips for Best Results

- Record in landscape mode
- Keep the camera steady
- Ensure good lighting
- Try to keep the ball in frame
- 30-60 seconds is ideal length
- Avoid zooming in/out while recording

## üß™ Testing the App

We've included sample videos to test with:

```bash
cd backend
python analyze_sample.py --video ../sample_videos/clear_touches.mp4
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### "Command not found" errors
- Make sure Python and Node.js are installed
- Restart your terminal after installation

### "Module not found" errors
- Make sure you activated the virtual environment
- Re-run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Video processing takes too long
- Try shorter videos (30-60 seconds)
- Ensure your computer isn't running other heavy programs
- Use "Quick Mode" if available

### No ball detected
- Ensure the ball is clearly visible
- Try better lighting conditions
- The ball should be orange or white

## üåê Deployment (Making it Live)
